# HTML-school-project
Project for school. Requirements are : responsive web design, fetch API with JSON, form with full validation which sents data to local or sesion Storage.
FOR NOW ITS VERSION WITH FETCH AND XAMPP OR OTHER SERVER IS REQUIRED TO RUN IT BUT I WILL CHANGE IT AND I WILL ADD SOME DOCUMENTATION.
The first version had a slider with data taken from another server, but it required to run e.g. xamp. It is not necessary, so it will be deleted
